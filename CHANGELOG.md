### 2.0.2

- Fixed 1-Up being invisible when CastleGrounds was not installed

### 2.0.1

- Some config options were labeled incorrectly

### 2.0.0

- Scrap will now appear on vanilla moons by default

- Spawns are configurable

##

### 1.0.3

- Bob-Omb now shows proper tooltip

- ? block items should spawn now

- No longer a hard dependancy for the SM64 moons 

Will be deprecated until I get some config settings in place to spawn on any moon. This won't spawn on any moon as is (unless using old versions of SM64 moons.) The SM64 moons now have their own unique scraps baked in to their individual mods

### 1.0.2

Reverted to 1.0.0, 1.0.1 was broken


### 1.0.0

First release!
